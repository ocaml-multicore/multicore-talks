## Other resources

[Parallel Programming in Multicore OCaml](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/parallel-programming-in-multicore-ocaml) is an in-progress book chapter that covers some of the same material as this talk but does so in more depth.

[Multicore OCaml's opam repo](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/multicore-opam) has instructions for installing Multicore OCaml along with domainslib.

The [OCaml Multicore Github Wiki](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/wiki) contains links to many more articles on Multicore OCaml as well as notes on the memory model, garbage collector and other lower-level topics. Note: some of the older articles and wiki pages may not describe the current state of multicore.
