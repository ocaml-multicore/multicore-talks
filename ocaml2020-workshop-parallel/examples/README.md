These are the examples used in the talk. 

To set up Multicore OCaml, Dune and Domainslib use the instructions from the [multicore-opam repo](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/multicore-opam) as these are kept in sync.

Building these examples should then just be a matter of running:

```
dune build
```

which will put executables in to the _build/default directory.
